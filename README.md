## Design Process
 
Understadning the goal of my project was important. With the objective of wanting to impress my future employers , I sat through and thought about what my bosses 
would want to see and know before hiring me. Once I set the goal , I went to craft out the cope to find out what web page and features were needed to reach this goal. After much consideration ,
I decided that my webpage should have the following :  a small write up about myself , Education institutes attended , Technical Skills, Soft Skills & the various awards 
I have obtained over the years.

After crafting out the elements in my portfolio , I went about making the wireframes. The wireframes had to be implemented for both the Desktop and Mobile
versions so I can get the bigger picture of how a responsive website should look and what I want my final outcome to be like.

A list of User Stories
- As a user type , I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.
- As a prospective employer, I would want to know what my employee is capable of after viewing his/her expertise so that I can hire the most capable staff for the company
- As a prospective employee , I want to let my employer know what I am capable of so that they can hire me to serve their their company.
- As a propective student, I will build this portfolio in the time to come and make it eveolve so that this can serve as an area for me to showcase my abilities and projects 
that I have emabrked on over my education years.
 
 
The follwoing are links to the Wireframes. Do take a look.

Mobile Compatibility
- Reach out to a wider audience
- It helps me build my credibility when clients propective individuals view my site on their mobile. They would have a better 
experience if the website is responsive.

 
### Existing Features
- Feature 1 
  - Ability to flex my navigation bar, adapt to mobile sizes
- Feature 2 
  - Clean structure and layout
- Feature 3
  - Easy Navigation at the top and bottom

There are many more features to be implemented in the future. currently , I can think of one feature I would like to implement

### Features Left to Implement
- Upcoming Feature 1
  - When website is sized down to a mobile a hamburger menu is an icon used on the top right & when clicked, opens to reveal a navigation menu. 
    Javascript should be implemented to achieve this. Currently when the site in on mobile, the navigation links just flexes and arranges itself in a column.

## Technologies Used

- [HTML]
    - HTML provides the basic structure to the website. Everything from the header to the footer is implement here.
- [CSS]
    - CSS is used to style the items in the website. Such as the colors , fonts , sizes , transitions etc. 
      Essentially styles and design the website.


## Testing

Contact form
- In the contact form , I have stated that it is required for the user toinput in their details like their name , email etc. When the user tries to submit the form without 
  the necessary fields filled in, the form will generate a "please enter into this field" message. This is achieved using the required keyword in the input type.
  But my form does not validate the email where it looks out for invalid email addresses. This is something Iwould like to implement in the time to come.
 
My project responses accordingly when the screen resizes. I have accomadated to one of the smaller sized phones, the Galaxy Fold. I have used media query and flex to achieve this.
However iterestingly , my index.html button loses it background color when Iaccess it via mobile phone. I have not found a solution to this problem and i think It is a bug.
